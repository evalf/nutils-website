description: |
  Nutils can read a (gmsh) mesh file (with boundary tags). To demonstrate
  it we consider a Laplace's equation on a quarter annulus. In this example 
  we create a .geo file of quarter annulus with boundary tags, generate a 
  .msh file and solve Laplace's equation by applying boundary conditions on 
  the prescribed boundary tags in nutils.
