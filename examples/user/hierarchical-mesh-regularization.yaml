description: |
  This example demonstrates a prototypical mesh regularization algorithm for
  hierarchical meshes. Although this algorithm is conceptually straightforward,
  it requires the advanced use of the Nutils element data structures (in
  particular the transformations that are used to identify elements). This
  example also aims to demonstrate how to use these data structures.
