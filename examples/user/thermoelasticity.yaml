description: |
  This example considers the thermal deformation of a hollow 
  cylinder. First, a heat problem is solved, where the temperature from the 
  boundary diffuses into the inner cylinder. The solution to this problem 
  is used as the initial temperature in a linear thermoelastic problem. 
  As the resulting temperature - a homogeneous field - is known, the temperature
  equation does not need to be solved. 
  More information regarding the theory of elasticity and thermoelasticity 
  can be found in, for example, ["Elasticity - Therory, Application and 
  Numerics" by M. Sadd][Sadd2014]
