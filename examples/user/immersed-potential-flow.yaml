  This example demonstrates the immersed (isogeometric) finite element method
  for the simulation of a two-dimensional non-lifting potential flow over a
  cylinder. A rectangular ambient domain of size L×L is considered, from which
  a circle of radius R is trimmed, resulting in the physical domain Ω. Neumann
  conditions are imposed on all boundaries in accordance with the exact
  solution. A zero-average potential constraint is added using a Lagrange
  multiplier to yield the (well-posed) boundary value problem.
