  In this script we solve Laplace's equation \\(u_{,kk} = 0\\) on a unit
  square domain \\(Ω\\) with boundary \\(Γ\\), subject to boundary
  conditions:

  \\[\left\\{\begin{aligned}
            u &= 0                     && Γ_{\rm left} \\\\
        ∂_n u &= 0                     && Γ_{\rm bottom} \\\\
        ∂_n u &= \cos(1) \cosh(x_1)    && Γ_{\rm right} \\\\
            u &= \cosh(1) \sin(x_0)    && Γ_{\rm top} \\\\
  \end{aligned}\right.\\]

  This case is constructed to contain all combinations of homogenous and
  heterogeneous, Dirichlet and Neumann type boundary conditions, as well as to
  have a known exact solution:

  \\[ u_{\rm exact} = \sin(x_0) \cosh(x_1). \\]
