  In this script we solve the Laplace problem on a unit square that has the
  bottom-right quadrant removed (a.k.a. an L-shaped domain) with Dirichlet
  boundary conditions matching the harmonic function

  \\[ \sqrt[3]{x^2 + y^2} \cos\left(\tfrac23 \arctan\frac{y+x}{y-x}\right), \\]

  shifted by 0.5 such that the origin coincides with the middle of the unit
  square. This variation of a well known benchmark problem is known to converge
  suboptimally under uniform refinement due to a singular gradient in the
  reentrant corner. This script demonstrates that optimal convergence can be
  restored by using adaptive refinement.
